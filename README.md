Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks
Hi all, this is a fairly standard introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks as part of my course at IBM. Here you will find examples of tools, languages and examples of Python used by Data Scientists. 
As this is part of the course it will not cover a large amount of things and not in specific detail but expect more projects to be uploaded soon.
